"""The one thread that talks to LIRA.

COM objects created in a single-threaded apartment may only be called from the thread that
created them, so every LIRA call goes through this worker's queue and runs here, one at a
time. Between jobs the worker pumps Windows messages: LIRA delivers its COM events (for
example "analysis finished") as messages to this thread.
