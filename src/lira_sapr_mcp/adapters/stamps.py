"""Stamps that tie LIRA's analysis results to the model the server analysed.

LIRA keeps results in its work folder by model name only, so two models of the same name
from different folders share them, and a model saved after its analysis keeps the old
ones. After each analysis it runs, the server writes ``<work>/<name>.lira-mcp.json``: the
model's path, when the results were written and when the model file was saved. Reading
results compares them with the model and explains why the results may not be its own.
LIRA rewrites the model file at the end of the analysis and the same bytes are never
saved twice, so only file times can be compared, not contents.
